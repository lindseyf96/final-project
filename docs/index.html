</div></div> <main id="content"> <div class="black-color"> <div class="story-body"><br><br> <p>Brad Galloway was looking for a sense of belonging when his friend approached him with an idea. Galloway had a tough adolescence -- he had already landed in jail multiple times by age 19 and was desperate for a sense of belonging. With a turbulent past and a desperate need to fit in somewhere, he became the perfect candidate for what his friend had in mind: join the white supremacist movement.</p> <p>“If he was a member of The Irish Republican Army or a street gang or biker gang, I would have joined that,” Galloway said. “I was legit looking for some criminal group to be a part of.”</p> <p>He became a skinhead –- including the shaved head, Doctor Martens boots and black bomber jacket –- and went on to become a national leader for Volksfront, a now defunct neo-Nazi group whose goal was to establish a white utopia in the Pacific Northwest.</p> <p>Galloway was part of the movement for 13 years before he decided to leave. While he didn’t partake in any violence himself (he was more in charge of the leadership side), he witnessed many vengeful acts and hate crimes, including ones where people died.</p> <p>“Some people I encountered had done 30 year sentences for their part in different types of hate related offenses,” Galloway said. “One was attacking a homeless man in the Portland area, another one was domestic terrorist related, there was a murder plotted for a radio personality guy, even armed robbery stuff.” </p> <p>Last month, the FBI released hate crimes reported to the agency in 2018. The map below shows which states have the most reported hate crimes per person. Hover over it to see more information. D.C., which is too small to show up on the map, had the highest number of hate crimes per capita, at 1 for every 2,718 people. Washington state –- where Volksfront had a high population –- is also in the top hate groups per capita, along with New Jersey, Michigan, among others. </p> <br><center><h2>Hate crimes per capita in 2018</h2></center> <div id="chart-2"></div>
</div> <script src="chart-02.29278562.js"></script> <div class="story-body"> <p>Galloway, who stars in a <a href="https://www.filmoptioninternational.com/skinhead">documentary</a> about his experiences in the far right, decided to leave the movement for many reasons, but cited his family and his exhaustion with the ideology and violence as the main factors.</p> <p>“It’s super challenging to try to hate a bunch of different people for no reason,” he said. “I was always playing with this idea of do I really hate these people or why do I have to conform to this belief system.” </p> <p>Now he is studying criminology at University of Fraser Valley and is a research intervention specialist with Prevention of Violence Canada, where he researches dynamics among extremist groups. </p> <p>After Galloway left in 2011, Volksfront disbanded a few years later. But hate groups have been rising in this country –- and if current trends continue, that number will increase even more.</p> <p>A linear regression model used the number of hate groups from 2000 to 2018, tallied by the Southern Poverty Law Center, to predict the number of groups in future years. The count per year from the SPLC and this regression are shown in the chart below. </p>

<div class="story-body">
<p>Galloway said the increasing number of hate groups and hate crimes is partially due to the Internet, which allows groups to spread their message more easily. But it is also because of indifference, he added. </p> <p>“It’s very problematic how these hate groups and rise of hate incidents are not being looked at in a serious enough way,” he said. “When we see what’s going on, when we see pictures like police officers giving the Hitler salute, where are we at systematically? … It’s almost reinvigorating these hate movements, by them seeing it’s rotten at the core -- it substantiates their extremist causes.” </p>

After implementing services, such as receiving an assigned person to walk families through the apartment application process, the percentage of people using the vouchers to move to "better" neighborhoods rose by 40 percent. </p> <p>For now, there are still a high number of hate crimes reported in Seattle. Other large cities have also seen a rise in hate crimes and violence, but Seattle is unique because it is the only place in the country in the top five for every hate crime category in 2018. </p> <h2>Seattle is in the top 5 for every hate crime category</h2> <div class="story-body"> <div class="bar-charts"> <div class="bar-chart1"> <div style="margin-left:110px;"><h3>Race</h3></div> <div id="bar-chart1"></div> </div> <script src="bar-chart1.76a037f0.js"></script> <div class="bar-chart2"> <div style="margin-left:100px;"><h3>Religion</h3></div> <div id="bar-chart2"></div> </div> <script src="bar-chart2.ec46388c.js"></script> <div class="bar-chart3"> <div align="right"><h3>Sexual Orientation</h3></div> <div id="bar-chart3"></div> </div> <script src="bar-chart3.8dbc0f91.js"></script> <div class="bar-chart4"> <div style="margin-left:100px;"><h3>Disability</h3></div> <div id="bar-chart4"></div> </div> <script src="bar-chart4.e96539ee.js"></script> <div class="bar-chart5"> <div style="margin-left:115px;"><h3>Gender</h3></div> <div id="bar-chart5"></div> </div> <script src="bar-chart5.706575d7.js"></script> <div class="bar-chart6"> <div align="right"><h3>Gender Identity</h3></div> <div id="bar-chart6"></div> </div> </div> <script src="bar-chart6.a86a74e3.js"></script> <style>.bar-charts>div{width:33%;flex-grow:1;overflow:hidden}</style> <p>Galloway is from Canada, but spent a “considerable amount of time” in Oregon and Washington, including Seattle, during his time as a white supremacist. Volksfront was founded in Oregon and quickly spread to Washington. He said he witnessed more violence in those areas than when he was part of Canada's neo-nazi movement.</p> <p>His group used various hate symbols, and so do many others. The Anti-Defamation League, a jewish civil rights group, keeps a longstanding list of hate symbols. Here are some of them.

</div> <script src="hate-symbols.f50d2534.js"></script> <div class="story-body"> <p>If Galloway could talk to his 19-year-old self, he would warn against becoming part of a movement that demonizes others. </p> <p>“Our interactions mean so much and we have to be careful how we treat each other, because that's what’s causing everything that's been going on,” he said. “Black and white thoughts don’t help anything.” </p>
<div class="methodology"> <h4>Methodology and Notes</h4> <p>The national hate map shows FBI 2018 hate crime data and does not include Wyoming or Alabama, because no police precinct in those states reported hate crimes. It is important to note that this map only includes reported hate crimes. Many hate attacks or vandalism do not get reported or are dismissed by police precincts. Therefore, this map is an underrepresentation of the total amount of hate crimes that occured in this country in 2018.</p> <p>The information for the hate group linear regression chart came from the Southern Poverty Law Center. It is important to note that while the number of hate groups is shown as increasing, that is by the SPLC's definition of what a hate group is. This definition has become more broad in recent years and various categories such as hate music have been added that some find questionable. The linear regression prediction was calculated by taking the number of hate groups recorded by the SPLC from 2000 to 2018 and running a line of best fit through the data until the year 2030. </p> <p>The old Seattle map is taken from Wikipedia (creative commons) and was drawn in 1938 for a sanitary survey. The choropleth map of the percentage of white individuals per census tract was taken from 2010 census data for Kings County, WA. The calculation for this is: dividing the number of people who identify as white per tract by the total number of individuals in each tract and multiplying that by 100.</p> <p>The six hate crimes per category charts are taken from FBI 2018 hate crime data and show the total counts for each city in the top five by type of hate crime.</p> <p>Click <a href="https://github.com/lindseyf96/final-project">here</a> to see the code and analysis for this project.</p>
