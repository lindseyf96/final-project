<b>What my project is:</b>

I'm looking at hate groups and hate crimes. I am going to compare these two stats for a bunch of cities in the United States, then focus on New York state as a whole.


<b>Who is in the group:</b>

Just me :) 


<b>Where your data is coming from:</b>

Southern Poverty Law Center hate groups data, FBI hate crimes data


<b>Your current status in terms of data acquisition/analysis/visualization:</b>

I have all the data I need, I just need to get shape files and make the data usable in QGIS (add FIPS data to everything, maybe zip codes). For analysis, I have done a significance test comparing hate groups from 2014 to 2018. I will have a map with interactive scrollytelling using Mapbox. I also want to interview a specific person who used to be in a neo-nazi hate group and use that info to create an interactive game. I will also show hate group symbols (requested by Jeremy). I will also have a linear regression chart. Other charts are tbd. 


<b>Sketch of what the final project might look like, noting any interactivity:</b>

<li>
<ul>Header image + title text</ul>
<ul>then explainer text + linear regression chart</ul>
<ul>then interactive map showing cities, then zooming into nyc</ul>
<ul>then more explainer text + hate group symbols</ul>
<ul>then interactive game (or link to a page with the interactive game)</ul>
<ul>then rest of explainer text and other charts</ul>
