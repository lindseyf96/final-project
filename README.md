<b>My Project</b>

I looked at hate groups and hate crimes in this country, first on a broad scale, then looking at various cities, and finally focusing on Seattle. I also included information such as hate symbols and how to leave a hate group.


<b>My Data Sources</b>

Southern Poverty Law Center hate groups data from 2000 to 2018, FBI 2018 hate crimes data, 2010 Census data, and Wikipedia Creative Commons


<b>Methodology and Notes</b>

The national hate map shows FBI 2018 hate crime data and does not include Wyoming or Alabama, because no police precinct in those states reported hate crimes. It is important to note that this map only includes reported hate crimes. Many hate attacks or vandalism do not get reported or are dismissed by police precincts. Therefore, this map is an underrepresentation of the total amount of hate crimes that occured in this country in 2018.

The information for the hate group linear regression chart came from the Southern Poverty Law Center. It is important to note that while the number of hate groups is shown as increasing, that is by the SPLC's definition of what a hate group is. This definition has become more broad in recent years and various categories such as hate music have been added that some find questionable. The linear regression prediction was calculated by taking the number of hate groups recorded by the SPLC from 2000 to 2018 and running a line of best fit through the data until the year 2030.

The old Seattle map is taken from Wikipedia (creative commons) and was drawn in 1938 for a sanitary survey. The choropleth map of the percentage of white individuals per census tract was taken from 2010 census data for Kings County, WA. The calculation for this is: dividing the number of people who identify as white per tract by the total number of individuals in each tract and multiplying that by 100.

The six hate crimes per category charts are taken from FBI 2018 hate crime data and show the total counts for each city in the top five by type of hate crime.

Other analysis, including what was shown in the Mapbox interactive, was done in QGIS and later edited in Mapbox Studio.
