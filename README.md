What my project is:

I'm looking at hate groups and hate crimes. I am going to compare these two stats for a bunch of cities in the United States, then focus on New York state as a whole.


Who is in the group:

Just me :) 


Where your data is coming from:

Southern Poverty Law Center hate groups data, FBI hate crimes data


Your current status in terms of data acquisition/analysis/visualization:

I will have a map with interactive scrollytelling using Mapbox. I also want to interview a specific person who used to be in a neo-nazi hate group and use that info to create an interactive game. I will also show hate group symbols (requested by Jeremy). Other charts are tbd. 


Sketch of what the final project might look like, noting any interactivity:

Header image + title text
then explainer text
then interactive map showing cities, then zooming into nyc
then more explainer text + hate group symbols
then interactive game (or link to a page with the interactive game)
then rest of explainer text and other charts
