            <h2>Hate Symbols Explained</h2>
            <p>The Anti-Defamation League launched its <a href="https://www.adl.org/hate-symbols">database</a> in 2000. It has grown to include over 200 entries.</p>

            <p><b>Volksfront</b></p><p>The group Galloway was part of might be defunct, but the ADL still lists some of its symbols. The first one is the Volksfront logo, the second one is the group's flag, and the third one is the group's hand sign, in the shape of a sideways "V".</p>
        </div>

         <div class="step" data-show-selector='#grid-step-2'>
            <p><b>General Hate</b></p><p>Many of the hate symbols in the database are used by multiple groups. These include: the swastika, The Aryan Fist (adopted from the "black power fist" used by black nationalist groups in the 1960s and 1970s), The hammerskin hand sign (used by the racist skinhead group The Hammerskins, but among other skinhead groups as well), and the confederate flag.</p>

        <div class="step" data-show-selector='#grid-step-3'>
            <p><b>Numbers and Words</b></p><p> Many hate symbols are seemingly normal numbers or words. 14 is shorthand for the white supremacist slogan "14 Words": "We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children." AYAK is KKK shorthand for "Are You A Klansman?" H8 means hate. “Anudda Shoah” is used to mock Jews.</p> <p>Others not on this chart include 88 (Heil Hitler), 9% (the percentage of the world's population that is supposedly white), and ZOG ("Zionist Occupied Government," meaning the U.S. government is controlled by Jews).</p>

        <div class="step" data-show-selector='#grid-step-4'>
            <p><b>New Additions</b></p><p>In September 2019, the ADL added 36 new symbols to its database. Here are four of them. “Moon Man” is a character in 1980s McDonald’s restaurant commercials that was appropriated by white supremacists. "Okay" is a common hand gesture claimed by many on the right -- not just extremists -- for the purpose of trolling liberals. Pepe the Frog is a viral meme that white supremacists took control of. The bowlcut hair-style portrays white supremacist mass killer Dylan Roof.</p>

        <div class="step" data-show-selector='#grid-step-5'>
            <p><b>Overall</b></p><p>In the database there are 82 specific hate group symbols, 69 general hate symbols, 26 hate slogans, 24 hate acronyms, 24 numeric hate symbols, and 18 racist hand signs, among other categories.</p>
